I was flunking out of college. I had a 1.7 grade point average. I hope none of you can relate. I had a 1.7 grade point average. I was sitting in my mother's beauty shop. They still call it beauty shops now. What they call it now? Yeah. I'll sit in the beauty parlor. I was sitting in my mother's beauty parlor and I'm looking in the mirror and I see behind me, this woman under the dryer. And every time she looked up, she, every time I looked up, she was looking at me. Just look at me in the eye. I didn't know who she was. And I said, you know, she said, somebody give me a pen. Give me a pencil. I have a prophecy. March 27, 1975. She said, boy, you are going to travel the world and speak to millions of people. Now, mind you, I flunked out of college. I'm thinking about joining the army. I didn't know what I was going to do. And she's telling me I'm going to travel the world and speak to millions of people. Well, I have traveled the world and I have spoke to millions of people, but that's not the most important thing. The success that I had, the most important thing is that what she taught me and what she told me that day has stayed with me since I've been protected. I've been directed. I've been corrected. Fail big. That's right. Fail big. Fail big, you only live once.
