Here is the meeting text:Alright, so we only have two days in Boston. What do you guys want to do? I definitely want to check out some of the historical sites. Maybe walk the Freedom Trail or something? Yeah, that's a good idea. We should start at the beginning of the trail in Boston Common and then make our way to the USS Constitution Museum. Sounds good. How about we grab some breakfast at Mike's Pastry before we start the trail? They have the best cannolis. Oh, I've heard about that place. I've also heard about another pastry shop called Best Pastry. I don't know. Let's just stick with Mike's Pastry. Definitely down for that. Yeah, I think going with Mike's Pastry sounds like a better option. But yeah, after the museum, we could definitely head over to the North End and grab some lunch at one of the Italian restaurants there. That's a great idea. I love Italian. I've heard the seafood is also amazing in Boston. Maybe you could try to fit in a seafood dinner at some point. Definitely. We should also try to see some of the other historical sites in Boston, like the Paul Revere House and the Old North Church. I don't think I'm particularly down for the seafood dinner, considering I'm a vegetarian. But yeah, I think you guys could go along and I could just go around and look at the Boston Tea Party ships and the museum. Yeah, that sounds interesting. That would be cool. But what about the second day? Well, for the second day, I was thinking that maybe we could take a cruise. I heard the Boston Harbor Islands are really nice at this time of the year. Maybe we could take a ferry out there and spend the day hiking and exploring. That sounds like a great idea. I just hope the weather cooperates with us. But if it is pleasant, we could pack some snacks and have a picnic on the beach. Yeah, sure. I haven't had a picnic on the beach in a long time. Maybe we could also have something for dinner. We could try some of the local craft beer and food at Hawthorne Brewery. Oh, that's a great idea. There are also a lot of other breweries around like the Sam Adams Brewery and craft breweries like Trillium. Apart from the breweries, we could also try to fit in a visit to the Museum of Fine Arts or the New England Aquarium if we have time. Anushka, that sounds like a wonderful idea. I think going to Sam Adams sounds very interesting to me. And after that, we could also hit the Boston Public Library. It's supposed to be really beautiful in terms of its architecture and the collection of the books it has. Yes, Poojita, we can add that to the list. I think we have a pretty solid itinerary right now. We just need to figure out transportation and timing for everything. Yeah, we can use the subway. I hear that they call the subway the T. They also have like five different modes of transportation. In the T, and it's really interesting to me, they have like old trams. They also have underground railways. And they also have a water boat as a mode of transport for the subway system. How cool is that? So I think using the T and also walking when possible to save the money, both of this can be done. What do you think about this? I did not know that they had so many modes of transport. That sounds very cool to me. And I think we could also save the pain of having to park our car everywhere we go and looking for parking spots. And yeah, I think for both the days, it's important to get an early start so that we don't miss anything in our itinerary. Agreed. I'm so excited for this trip. I feel like I haven't explored Boston and this seems to be like a perfect opportunity to see what Boston has to offer. Wait, hold on. We're just talking about traveling everywhere and exploring all the sites. What about relaxing? I mean, why are we going to Boston all along? Like we decided that we wanted to spend some quality time relaxing and enjoying the city. And I don't think there's a better way to do that. Except going to a Red Sox game. How about we go to a sports game? A sports game? That's not really my thing. Yeah, I agree with Poojita on this one. I'm not really into sports either. Do you have any other alternative? No, what are you talking about, guys? It's such a quintessential Boston experience. We could go see the Red Sox at Fenway Park or the Celtics at TD Garden. Did you know the Red Sox season literally just started yesterday? My friend who lives in Boston and really close to Fenway Park says that it's unmissable. Yeah, I don't know. I feel like we already have a pretty packed itinerary. And tickets to sports games can be very expensive. True. I'm tight on the budget as well, and we might also not be able to get good seats since it's such short notice. All right. I guess we don't have to go to a sports game. But I still think we should try to incorporate everyone's interest into our itinerary. Yeah, that's a good point. I think it's just fair. Maybe we could each choose one thing that we really want to do and make sure we fit it into our schedules. I really like that idea. What's everyone's must-do activity over here in Boston? Well, I really want to go to a brewery and try some local craft beer. I heard that Boston has amazing breweries, and my friend is always talking a lot about how the beer there is so great. I think it's a must, in my opinion. That sounds fun, but I think I really want to see the Boston Public Garden and take a leisurely stroll through the park. And if the weather is good, I think it will be a great experience for us to just soak in some fresh air and be away from the hustle and bustle of the city. I understand all your concerns, but I also think that we should still try to fit in everything we planned. We can always adjust our itinerary if we need to, but I don't want to miss out on anything. I see your point, and I understand that you want to discover all the places and experience the historically beautiful architecture of Boston, but I also don't want to rush through everything and not fully enjoy the experience. I really want to relax on this trip. I feel like I agree with both of you. Maybe we could compromise by prioritizing the activities that we really want to do, like Anushka wanting to try the beer and Mervyn you just wanting to do a lot of things during the trip. So maybe we'll just prioritize a few activities that we all want to do and we can be a little flexible with the rest. Yeah, I mean, and also Poojita does not eat oysters, so maybe we could just go to a place that serves both vegan food and seafood. I hear that Citizens Oyster Bar is really great. We could get fresh oysters and fresh seafood there Mervyn, and we could also get Poojita some really nice vegan food. What do you think about that? Sure, I'm really looking forward to try some oysters. That's a really good idea. I think it's time we can revise our itinerary. Let's go over it again and see if there are any adjustments we can make. Yeah, I have to admit, I'm a little hesitant about our itinerary, but I'm also excited to go through it. We will get to see and do so much in just two days. I agree with you Anushka, and I really appreciate you looking out for me with the vegan food and trying to incorporate my interests into the trip. And I think we will be able to compromise and make adjustments when necessary. It will make the trip more enjoyable for all of us. True, at the end of the day, I'm just happy that we will be able to experience Boston together. It's a city that has so much to offer, and I think we did a great job of exploring it. Okay guys, see you in Boston. Bye! See you! Bye! Bai.
