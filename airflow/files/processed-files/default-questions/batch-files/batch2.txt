Here is the meeting text:Hi, Poojita. Hi, Marvin. Yeah, so I really want to discuss about this LinkedIn course, which I found really interesting. It's about a project initiative called Be Real, Leap Amp, which is an intellectual brainchild of two UC Berkeley students. They worked on this project over the course of three months where they research, strategize and design ways to make incremental adjustments to interface for a more timeless user experience. Be Real's impromptu nature, which is the sole purpose of creating this application, has enabled users to establish a more organic and natural network with each other since it prompts users with a notification a day and the user then being allowed to only post a picture within a two minute time frame, which poses a more genuine, authentic social interaction with other users that are using this app. Then if I were to talk about the unique selling proposition of this platform, it's that it positions itself as anti-Instagram because Instagram has been used synonymously with anything that's unauthentic and it's something that's mainly catered to creators and influencers, whereas this app mainly caters to college students, particularly Gen Zs, as people might loosely or liberally throw around this word. And its main purpose is to form those authentic, genuine connections by putting the vulnerable side of you through this application and therefore it aims at providing a platform for a more genuine, appetizable post from users. And it also has another unique USP of enabling users to spend less time on the app. So for instance, the marketing strategy of the platform is such that it advertises a platform on college campuses, so it's kind of telling that it's mainly catered to college students and it markets in such a way that it offers free admission to parties if students download the app and add our recommended five friends. And as far as the financial model is concerned, it mainly generates revenue through investments and it does not rely on any subscription purchases or in-app ads. So the Bereal revamp is a movement towards anti-Instagram, like you said, and the authenticity on the, to restore authenticity on internet. So Bereal has been going on for a while now, for like a year and a half, and it has been going really well, but to ensure Bereal's longevity and to ensure that the app is here for a long time and not just for a short time, these people have tried to create a Bereal revamp project to just showcase the ways in which we can keep Bereal alive. So they're doing this from a product and an interface standpoint, and they're trying to figure out a solution to how to do this. So in this LinkedIn post that you'd mentioned and I'd gone through, they had divided the project into several phases. So first they've gone through the research phase and then they've seen the user personas. Then there was some planning and analysis involved, and then they've come up with a workable prototype, and then they've given their thoughts and reflections on the same. So the research phase, they have done extensive research on the matter. They have done internal company research, they have done competitor analysis, they have done user research, market research, and user personas. Okay, so talking about the competitor analysis, they have taken into consideration both the popular social media platforms as well as other similar social media platforms as well. So if you were to talk about the popular social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, or TikTok, the common strength that all of these social media platforms have is that they have a really large and established user base, and they're mainly catered to creators and influencers. And their main source of revenue comes from advertisement and in-app purchases as well as subscriptions. So in the competitor placement graph, if we were to put BDL, Revamp app with all the other competitors, we'll notice that it not only has a high user loyalty, but since due to its marketing approach, it has fared really well with the values of the Gen Z user base. And it also has had a positive online reputation due to its authentic, genuine approach. However, because of the financial aspect, which is that it only earns through investments, and that it one of its main value being that it only it wants users to spend less time on the application, it may not be a feasible financial model. So their hypothesis for this project is that we all know that everyone's craving a more authentic form of social media, where everything is not just for show, and everything is just not very curated and very artificial. So BDL's whole strategy is that it wants to create memories in real time, it wants the users to be able to create memories in real time. And this, we expect a positive user feedback to this unique thing, which is not seen in the market anywhere. And the second hypothesis that they've taken is that people want more personalized and meaningful connections, as opposed to people having 500-600 followers on Instagram or 70-80 friends on Snapchat. This sounds like a very good place where you can only connect with your friends and unbind and just have your friendly chat going on. And this is usually meant for closer friends and inner circles where you can do and be yourself without feeling shy or without feeling judged. And their third hypothesis is that just to keep BDL from being any other social media platform, which is power hungry and very advertisement focused platform. And now the problem is that we need to be able to get or have an incentive to get the users to post on time. Like you said, they have a two minute window and a notification pops off every day, once every day. So there has to be an incentive for the users to capture their raw and authentic moments right on time. And the problem statement that we've taken here is that our value proposition for users. So to keep the engagement high and to incentivize the users to abide by the BDL's two minute rule, which is what we've discussed earlier. So for this, they believe that BDL must change their interface to tailor to the changing user needs. And as for user research, they've researched over 150 plus people and they found that the top three reasons as to why people use BDL, because BDL is an app just for close friends. And it is great because you get to see people's day to day activity, which is slightly different from Snapchat's user streaks, because we all know that people just keep sending blank snaps after a point to just maintain the streak. So there is no pressure of maintaining a streak with your friends. But it's just a fun way to catch up with your friends and see what everyone does on a day to day basis. And like other social media platforms, this is not going to be addictive. This is not designed to take much of your time every day. This is not an app that benefits from your time spent on the app. So this is why the users like to use BDL. The top three reasons as to why people like to use BDL. And the study also showed that the users go on BDL around two to five times a day, which is astronomically low from what people spend on Instagram or Snapchat or TikTok. But when they also did a study of the idea of potential ads on BDL, like how other apps have monetized their apps and have started advertising on it, turns out that over 90% of the people were opposed to the idea of any ads or any ad revenue on BDL.
