## Objective
Build a Meeting Intelligence tool using generative AI APIs such as **Whisper** and **GPT 3.5** APIs, integrated with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.iohttps://streamlit.io) for its user interface to illustrate application workflow illustration as well as [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/) for automation.

## APIs
**Whisper API:** API for [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) speech-to-text open-source model which provides two endpoints for transcriptions and translations and accepts variety of formats (m4a, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, wav, webm). For the purpose of this assignment, Whisper API has been implemented to transcribe audio from test meeting recordings and user uploaded audio files in mp3 format.

**GPT 3.5 API:** API for [ChatGPT 3.5](https://openai.com/research/whisper) model which takes sequence of messages coupled with metadata as tokens to generate text completion which can either be natural language or code. For the purpose of this assignment, GPT 3.5 API has been implemented to build a query engine complemented by the transcripts generated by Whisper.
